The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1. This was created by the Italian mathematician, Fibonacci. For example, the sequence goes: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, and so on. 

This is a javaScript program that I built to generate the Fibonacci sequence, where the user's input determines the length of the sequence.
